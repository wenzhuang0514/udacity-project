# Make Your App Material

## Project Overview
Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree 8th project

In this project, you will update the look and feel of an app to meet Material Design specifications.

## Why this Project?
This project gives you an opportunity to improve an appâ€™s design, a vital skill for building apps users will love. It also replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.

## What Will I Learn?
Through this project, you will:

* Understand the fundamentals of Android design.
* Apply Material Design guidelines to an mobile application.
* Separate an interface into surfaces.
* Effectively use transitions

## Required Tasks
* Download a zip file of the app.
* Read the UI Review in the next node.
* Spend time exploring the current state of the app, looking for ways it could be improved. The app will need multiple improvements. Be sure to look specifically at issues called out in the UI Review.
* Execute the improvements!
* Make a single GitHub repo with your code for the app and submit it through the Nanodegree portal. See the Submission and Evaluation node for detailed instructions.
